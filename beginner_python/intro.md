#Introduction - Learning how to talk to computers

## Is this the tutorial for you?   

This tutorial is for people who are learning their very first programming language.  Whether you are preparing to enter 
a computer coding school or bootcamp soon, thinking ahead about future work transitions, or trying to find out if you 
might enjoy computer programming at all, it can be hard to find a good first point of entry into programming.  This 
tutorial assumes that you probably know quite a lot about something and not a lot about computer programming.  For those 
who already know a lot about programming, another resource would most likely suit you much better and use familiar 
language and concepts keep you oriented as you are learning. 

## What will this tutorial help you do?  

What does it actually mean to learn computer programming?  If you are reading and understanding this paragraph now, then 
at some point, probably a long time ago, you put quite a lot of effort into developing basic literacy (in English, 
specifically, and many people and resources supported your learning, even if you hardly remember).  The goal of this 
tutorial is to guide people into a first next step in developing heightened or especially strong computer literacy.  

If you use computers regularly to send emails, search for information, visit websites, connect with people, pay 
bills, create text documents, and work with a handful of useful programs, then you are basically computer literate 
as a user.  You know how to work with a program someone else has designed and written to do something you want to do. 
Becoming a programmer means moving beyond just using software that other people have made into actually designing 
and writing software that other people can use.  

## A simple way of thinking about computer programming 

Programming, in a way, is simply knowing how to talk to computers.  Given that we probably all talk aloud 
to our computers - aggressively and ineffectually - when they are not doing what we want, more specifically, 
programming is talking to computers in a way that computers understand that gets them to do what you have in mind.  

Since you are used to interacting with computer programs as a user, a lot of what we do early on will seem unfamiliar to 
you. The beginner programmer practice that we do in this tutorial may seem abstract, "up in the air", or detached from 
your own everyday computer use. You usually do not interact directly with a computer program but with the *user 
interface* that the programmer(s) involved created for you to use.  From there, you give can inputs, such as texts and
clicks, and the program processes these inputs and brings back the correct outputs, such as your search 
results, the inbox connected to your particular email address, and the password to the game you saved.  

In this tutorial, we use the most basic forms of taking inputs and presenting outputs (so basic, you probably have
never seen them) in order to focus mainly on writing the code that does the processing and building skills here first.  
As you continue learning, you will see how multiple computer languages come together to form a website or program and 
how the *front-end* (the user interface that you have always seen) gets designed and written and how it works with the 
*back-end* (where everything is stored and processed) and how these are all just interrelated portions of computer code 
that people have written to all work with together to do something.  

The first thing you need is a strong foundation in a programming language.  Python is a particular good first language 
for beginner programmers, because it is so widely used and one of the basic principles of Python is to be as "human 
readable" as possible.  By learning to read and write *scripts*, which is the name for files written in 
computer languages, that come together to form basic programs that actually do something, you will gain a foundational 
understanding of how computer programming works.  The biggest and widest step you have to take in becoming a programmer 
is in understanding how the  words and symbols a script that seem bizarre at first can be anything useful at all.  

The words on this page make sense, because you understand the *syntax* and vocabulary of contemporary English, which 
essentially means that you know what goes where and so can make sense of these sentences.  A sentence written with bad 
syntax and grammar would be difficult to read:  Your ?brain hurt tHis o!ne wiLL m, ake.  And while you 
can probably still make sense of that very bad sentence, you will find that computers are much more dependent on proper 
syntax to read your code, do what you have written, and behave in predictable and desirable ways.  So learning proper 
Python syntax means learning how to write code that the Python program can read and interpret - basically, learning how 
to talk to computers.
