# Lesson 1 - Write and run your first Python program 

## What to do... 

Open Atom.  
Create a new file.  
Save your empty file as *lesson1.py* in the folder you created for your scripts called *python_files*
 

```python
print("Hello, World!")
```

Save your *lesson1.py* file.


Open your terminal and use the *change directory* command *cd* to get to your *python_files* folder.  
Hint:  You can use the *print working directory* command to see what directory you are in.  
Hint:  You can use the *list* command *ls* to see the files in the current directory.

From here, if you use the command *ls*, you should see your *lesson1.py* file.

Enter the following command in your terminal window:

```python ****
:~$ python lesson1.py 
```

The following line should appear in your terminal window:

```python 
Hello, World! 
```


Throughout this tutorial, you will follow this same pattern of:  
1.  opening Atom (or going to Atom if it's open already)  
2.  writing a Python script  
3.  saving the script  
4.  opening (or going to) your terminal  
5.  moving to your folder of scripts  
6.  running your script in Python  

Then you will be:  

7.  checking to see if your output matches what's expected
8.  (only if your output does not match what's expected) editing your script and running it again

## Did you see the exact output that was expected?  

```python
print("Hello, World!")
```

If not, you are probably receiving an *error message* in your terminal window.  

If you are seeing an error message that includes *command not found*: 
Did you use the *ls* command in your terminal to make sure that you were in your folder of Python scripts?

If you are seeing an error message that includes *SyntaxError: invalid syntax* or *NameError*: 

Did you type your script exactly the way it was shown?  
You can copy and paste to double check, but then try again to type the command exactly as it appears.

If you are still not getting the output you expected, reach out to someone to help you get started.
You can find someone in real life, or you can find someone online.  

## What you just did...  

Once you have finished this lesson, you have:
    1. Completed your set up for this entire tutorial!
    2. Written your first Python script!
    3. Run your first Python script!
    4. Created a string in Python!
    5. Called the string method in Python!
    
    
The term Python "script" refers to a file written in Python.  
Think of actors following the lines of a script.  
Your computer followed the lines of the Python script.  

You wrote a file that any computer that can understand the Python language can read.  
Your computer can understand the Python language, becuase you installed the Python program during set up.  

You went to your terminal to tell your computer to run this script.  
You used the command +python* to tell your computer which program to use to read your script.  

Think of the Python program as an interpreter or a specific "language brain."  
If you speak more than one language, then you probably know how it feels to suddenly need to switch languages.  
Even though you can understand that language, your brain needs a moment to switch.  
Your computer speaks multiple computer languages, but from your terminal, it needs to know which program to use to 
understand the language in the file it's about to read.  

    
So what do those last two (numbers 4. and 5.) mean?  

## Want to try this again?  

Choose any phrase to replace, "Hello, World!"  

Choose a new file name besides *lesson1.py* that uses only letters with no spaces and ends with *.py*.  

Write a new Python script and use print, (), and "" the exact same way with your new phrase in between.  

Run this new script in your terminal to see if you have printed your new phrase.
