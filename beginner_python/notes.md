Set-Up Part 1:  Installing Python 

Set-Up Part 2:  Installing and opening Atom 



Set-Up Part 3:  Using your terminal 

How tiny do I want them to be broken up?  

When to do comments?
When to do error messages / debugging?  
Those could be entire lessons, every other one even.

Lesson 3:  Using error messages for debugging 
Copy and paste scripts 
Figure out what's wrong.
Explain how to read the message and what's wrong.  

Lesson 4:  What else can we do with strings?  
concatonate 
multiply 


Lesson 5:  Using the string format method 
format 

Lesson 6:  Using string indexing 
indexing 

Lesson 7:  Commenting your code 
This creates notes for the lesson
Pseudo code 




Switch to math?




#Before this:
# programming is talking to computers
# a little about how computers think - data types
# input, processing, output

# Pattern -- tiny why and what overview:  actual coding session  :  step back and read the code  :  debugging and error messages  :  DIY

#Read back -- Explain:
#   comment lines, print lines, strings, variables
#Hard coded compared with variable.
#You just did the pattern input, processing, output!  The processing is just so simple, it's nearly invisible.

#Try your own
#Debugging and Error messages






#Later:
#Explain UI and API

#Start each new lesson with an refresher on the first?
#Create a pattern of accumulation.
#Slowly introduce lingo.
#Land on offering problems and NOT using tech language.
#Tutorial on pseudo coding.

#MVP
# Command line:  cd ls mkdir rm (resursive remove and idea of flags) mv (move) and cp(copy)
# Set up with Chris's video:  Getting Python and getting Atom

#Nice to Have
# IDE set up - Pycharm with Chris's video

#Write first Python lesson
#Iron out format
#Write command line tutorial
#Work with Chris on set up tutorial

#maybe little shorts of people talking about ideas that snagged them at the very beginning
